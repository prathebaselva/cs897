Switch to the Desired Local Branch:

Use the following command to switch to the branch where you want to make changes:
bash
Copy code
git checkout <local_branch_name>
Example:

bash
Copy code
git checkout feature-branch
Make Changes to Your Code:

Open your code editor and make the necessary changes to your files.
Add and Commit Changes Locally:

Stage your changes and commit them with a meaningful message:
bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Add descriptive commit message"
Push Changes to Remote Branch:

Push your local changes to the corresponding remote branch. Replace <remote_name> and <remote_branch> with the appropriate remote and branch names.
bash
Copy code
git push <remote_name> <local_branch_name>:<remote_branch_name>
Example (pushing changes from feature-branch locally to feature-branch on the remote named origin):
