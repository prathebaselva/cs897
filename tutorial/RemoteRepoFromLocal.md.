# Git Tutorial: Create a New Remote Repository from Local Machine

Welcome to the Git tutorial on creating a new remote repository from your local machine. This guide will walk you through the steps to initialize a new remote repository and push your existing local project to it.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:
- A Git repository set up locally.
- Git installed on your machine: [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

## Steps to Create a New Remote Repository

1. **Navigate to Your Local Repository:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.

   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/local/repository

2. **Initialize a New Git Repository Locally (if not done already):**
   ```bash
   git init
   
3. **Create a New Remote Repository:**
   - Create a new repository and copy the Remote Repository URL (remote_url) and remote_name (e.g., origin or main)
   
4. **Set remote repository in local machine:**
   ```bash
   git remote add <remote_name> <remote_url>

5. **Confirm that the remote repository has been added:**
   ```bash
   git remote -v

6. **Push Your Code to the New Remote Repository:**
   Push your existing local code to the newly created remote repository. Replace <branch> with the branch name you 
   want to push (e.g., main):
   ```bash
   git push -u <remote_name> <branch>
