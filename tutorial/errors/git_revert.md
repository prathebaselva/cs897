Commit Not Found:

Cause: The specified commit hash or reference does not exist in the repository.
Solution: Verify the correctness of the commit hash or reference. Use git log to check the commit history.
Already Reverted:

Cause: Attempting to revert a commit that has already been reverted.
Solution: Check the commit history using git log to confirm if the commit has already been reverted.
You are in the Middle of a Revert:

Cause: Attempting to perform another operation while a previous revert is in progress.
Solution: Complete or abort the current revert before starting a new operation. Use git revert --abort if needed.
Uncommitted Changes:

Cause: There are uncommitted changes in the working directory.
Solution: Commit, stash, or discard local changes before attempting to revert.
Conflict in <file>:

Cause: There is a merge conflict during the revert process.
Solution: Manually resolve conflicts in the affected file(s). Use git status to identify conflicted files. After resolving, mark them as resolved with git add <file> and continue the revert with git revert --continue.
Refusing to Merge Unrelated Histories:

Cause: Attempting to revert a commit that is not part of the branch's history.
Solution: Use --allow-unrelated-histories to force the revert if necessary.
Your Local Changes Would Be Overwritten:

Cause: Uncommitted local changes conflict with the revert.
Solution: Commit, stash, or discard local changes before attempting to revert.
Merge Conflict in <file> during revert:

Cause: Conflicts arise when trying to revert a commit that affects the same lines as subsequent commits.
Solution: Manually resolve conflicts in the affected file(s) during the revert process. Use git status, resolve conflicts, mark as resolved with git add <file>, and continue with git revert --continue.
No Revert Commit:

Cause: No revert commit was created due to conflicts or issues.
Solution: Resolve any conflicts or issues during the revert process and complete the revert with git revert --continue.
