## 1.Error: "Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind"
  **Cause: This occurs when your local branch is not up-to-date with the remote branch, and someone else has pushed changes in the meantime.**
  **Solution:**
    ``` git pull origin <branch_name> ```
    - This command fetches the changes and merges them into your local branch.
    
## 1. Error: "Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge"
  **Cause: You have uncommitted changes in your local working directory that conflict with the changes to be pulled.**
  **Solution: Either commit your changes, stash them, or discard them before pulling:**
    ```git stash     # Stash local changes ```
    ```git pull origin <branch_name> ```
    ```git stash pop    # Apply stashed changes back ```
    
Error: "Please commit your changes or stash them before you merge"

Cause: Similar to the previous error, but Git explicitly asks you to commit or stash your changes.
Solution:
bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git pull origin <branch_name>
Error: "Merge conflict"

Cause: Git cannot automatically merge changes due to conflicting modifications in both your local and remote branches.
Solution:
Manually resolve the conflicts in the affected files.
Add the resolved files using git add <filename>.
Complete the merge with git merge --continue or git commit.
Error: "Cannot pull with rebase: You have unstaged changes."

Cause: You have changes in your working directory that are not yet committed or stashed.
Solution:
bash
Copy code
git stash
git pull --rebase origin <branch_name>
git stash pop
Error: "Permission denied (publickey)." or "Could not read from remote repository."

Cause: Issues with SSH key setup or repository access.
Solution:
Ensure your SSH key is added to your SSH agent.
Verify repository access and SSH key settings on the remote platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
Error: "fatal: unable to access 'URL': Failed to connect to repository"

Cause: Network issues or incorrect repository URL.
Solution:
Check your internet connection.
Verify the correctness of the repository URL.
Error: "The requested URL returned error: 403" or "Authentication failed"

Cause: Authentication issues, usually when trying to access a private repository.
Solution:
Ensure your credentials (username/password or token) are correct.
Check if your account has the necessary permissions.
